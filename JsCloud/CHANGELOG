2012-02-28 Version 0.1 Liang <liang@ccs.neu.edu>
A totally new version of FlashPeer and FlashPeerManager.

- FlashPeer uses inStream and outStream netStatus event to determine
connection status. Both streams are created at once, which is opposite
to the old version(the old uses a take turns).
- FlashPeerManager now holds a pubStream to detect new incoming
"outStream from another peer". It creates a new FlashPeer either by
user's action or detected a incoming stream.
- Now all events are dispatched via EventListenerMixin. It supports both
"addEventListener" and "onevent" styles of listening events.
- Debugging hints: There is a commented line in the Bridge and
EventListenerMixin that can monitor all flash-js communication and all
events.
